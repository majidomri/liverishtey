          <h2>Your Consent and Choices</h2>

            object to the processing of your data in certain circumstances.</p>

            information may remain in our private records after deletion of such information from your account for a
            retention period. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the
            right to access, the right to erasure, your rights to access, add to, and update your information cannot
            be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
          <p>We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
            disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
            Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
            personally.</p>
          <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
          <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our
            Website; improve customer service; process transactions; send notification emails such as password
            reminders, updates, etc; and operate our Website. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to
            identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This
            statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user
            of the system.</p>
          <p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given
            their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to
            process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent
            or any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
            Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is
            necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv)
            Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
            authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
            by us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies
            to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
          <h2>The rights of users</h2>
          <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
            right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your
            consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your
            information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right
            to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the
            processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify
            the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under
            certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process
            your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain
            circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to
            receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically
            feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
            provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your
            consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
          <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
          <p>Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
            vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
            processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must
            know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can
            object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether we are
            processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of
            this document.</p>
